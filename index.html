                                 I have completed different course related to programming languages but I gainded the most interest in web developement sector.
                                  I am working hard in learning both the front-end and the back-end frameworks. And my goal is to become a full stack developer near future.  </p>

                          <p>I was first introduced to C language during my first semester.I found it to be quite similar to c++ but didn't really get to explore the depths of the language because it was a short semester.
                                Still in this short semester I got basic idea on programming and started to gain interest in coding. I have build basic small application using C/C++.

                        <h2>C Sharp(C#) </h2>
                        <p>After I completed object oriented programmming course in java I was then taught C sharp. In this course I learned to work with ms win forms, NET-frameworks.
                              I build a windows application named travel agency management system. With the help of this application the users were able to book reservations for Hotel, Flights also can purchase various tour packages according to their requirement.  </p>
